# Current Projects

## Machine Learning:

### Scientific PDF Document Summarization:


-Exploring a comparison between BART and t5 models.

-Facing challenges in achieving visually appealing summarization outputs.



### Multi-Class Image Classification:

-Developing a model using ResNet50 and OpenImages dataset.

-Aiming to classify images containing one or more class objects.

### YOLO-Based Object Detection for Vehicles (dash cam or self-driving vehicle):

-Training YOLO to detect common objects encountered during driving, such as people, signs, traffic lights, crosswalks, and animals.

-Considering implementing a nano model, but system constraints (4GB RAM) may pose limitations on a ChromeOS tablet (Crostini Linux VM).
